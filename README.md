# [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

![Krampus](/assets/krampus.jpg)

Attempt to tackle the excellent advent of code with some familiar programming languages, C and Perl. And [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/), which is completely new to me.

Contrary to most people, I've lived under a rock and not worked extensively with Python, so some of the Nim syntax will take some getting used to

Will try to alternate between C, Perl, Nim as the challenges progress!
